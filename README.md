#BAMPFA Wraith Config

This is a config file to use for testing bampfa.org with BBC News' screenshot comparison tool [Wraith](http://bbc-news.github.io/wraith/).

To get up and running with Wraith follow the Pantheon instructions for [installing Wraith](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/visual-diff-with-wraith/). This documentation can be followed, but rather than customizing capture.yaml, it can be replaced with the capture.yaml contained in this repo.
